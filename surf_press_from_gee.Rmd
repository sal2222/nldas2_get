Import NLDAS 2 surface pressure CSV files from Google Drive, reshape, compile batches, and join with other NLDAS bands.
Values extracted through GEE script in `get_surface_pressure_earth_engine`.
Reshape from wide (timestamp as columns) to long (timestamp as variable).

Files are hourly by decade (task runtime from 3 - 10 hours each). A 32-year task timed out after 12 hours.


## Import files from Google Drive
```{r}
drive_auth(e-mail = "slewando1@gmail.com")

drive_find(n_max = 30)
